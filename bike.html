                    Royal Enfield was a brand name under which The Enfield Cycle Company 
                    Limited of Redditch, Worcestershire[1] sold motorcycles, bicycles, 
                    lawnmowers and stationary engines which they had manufactured.
                     Enfield Cycle Company also used the brand name "Enfield" without "Royal".
                    First Royal Enfield motorcycle was built in 1901. 
                    The Enfield Cycle Company is responsible for the design and original 
                    production of the Royal Enfield Bullet, the longest-lived motorcycle design in history.
                    Royal Enfield's spare parts operation was sold to Velocette in 1967, which benefitted 
                    from the arrangement for 3 years until their closure in early 1971. Enfield's 
                    remaining motorcycle business became part of Norton Villiers in 1967 with the business eventually closing in 1978.
                    Eadie had won contracts to supply precision parts for firearms to the government's long-established 
                    brand name Royal Enfield.[10] In 1896 they also incorporated a new subsidiary company, The New Enfield 
                    Cycle Company Limited,[note 1] to handle much of the cycle work and in 1897 Enfield making complete 
                    cycles as well parts for other assemblers took all the cycle assembly work from Eadie.

                That's said, Royal Enfield aka Bullet is an Indian motorcycle manufacturing
                 company that was established in 1955. The company manufactures minimalist, retro motorcycles
                  which still resembles an iconic history of the brand.

                ROYAL ENFIELD
                Talking of the brand, Royal Enfield has a niche
                 audience like you & me that prefers RE over Duke/Pulsars.
                 We like the minimal plastic work, styling,
                 and the way they churn exhaust note-Dug-Dug.
                  We usually click them & share the love over 
                  social media channels with proper Royal Enfield quote or captions.
